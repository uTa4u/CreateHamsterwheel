# Create: Hamsterwheel

A simple backport of [Create: Treadmill](https://modrinth.com/mod/createtreadmill) to Minecraft 1.20.1. All credits go to original developer, this port took literally 4 hours lol. If there are any bugs in **THIS** version of the mod, report them to **MY** issue tracker, **NOT** to the original developer.

## Description taken original mod (Create: Treadmill)

This mod adds a treadmill to Create Mod. Players can click to stand on the treadmill, and when a player runs on it, the treadmill generates twice the SU (Stress Units) compared to a Hand Crank.

It also has cross-mod compatibility with Touhou Little Maid. When installed, maids will gain a new "Treadmill" work mode, allowing them to seek out nearby treadmills and run on them.
